What is Pranayama?
To understand what is Pranayama, we need to understand the word Pranayama. Pranayama- is a combination of two Sanskrit words and is the fourth limb of Patanjali's Eight Limbs of Yoga. The word 'Prana' means bio-energy or life force, and 'Ayama' means regulation of this life force.
Pranayama involves the regulation and cessation of inspiratory and expiratory movements of breath in a steady posture (asana), as per Patanjali Yoga Sutra (Chapter 2:49). The traditional pranayama techniques in Hatha Yoga require a specific mindset and environment. Recognizing the challenges of these methods for modern householders, Shri Yogendraji, founder of The Yoga Institute, simplified the techniques into Yogendra Pranayamas, sequentially numbered from 1 to 9.
Advantages of Pranayama
Below are the 9 Yogendra Pranayamas with their benefits of pranayama:
1. Equalization of Breath
Benefit: Develops awareness of breathing and improves essential capacity by equalizing inhalation and exhalation durations.
2. Intercostal Breathing
3. Clavicular Breathing
4. Diaphragmatic Breathing
Benefit: Targets three groups of respiratory muscles for bionic efficiency in the clavicular, thoracic, and abdominal areas, creating lung area awareness.
5. Shunyaka - Suspe nsion of Breath (Post-exhalation)
6. Puraka - Prolonged Inhalation
7. Kumbhaka - Retention of Breath
8. Rechaka - Prolonged Exhalation
Benefit: Focuses on efficient management of the respirational cycle's four stages: suspension, inhalation, retention, and exhalation.
9. Yogendra Anuloma Viloma - Alternate Nostril Breathing
Benefit: Regulates air movement using alternate nostrils for specific purposes.
Importance of Pranayama
The importance of pranayama lies in learning rhythmic, uniform, slow, and harmonious breathing techniques. By controlling the breath, one can control bodily functions, develop a connection between body, mind, and soul, and improve physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Pranayama is more than just a set of breathing exercises; it affects the nervous system and overall health.
Physical Benefits of Pranayama
1. Increases Lung Capacity
Practicing pranayama removes stale air from the lungs, increases chest wall expansion, strengthens respiratory muscles, and promotes deep breathing. Fast-breathing pranayamas like Kapalbhati and Bhastrika enhance lung function.
2. Improves Immune System
Diaphragmatic breathing in pranayama engages the digestive system, which contains 80% of immune tissue, strengthening the body's immune response. Increased oxygen supply during pranayama stimulates the parasympathetic system and increases white blood cell count, shielding the body from infections.
3. Reduces Weight
Conscious, deep breathing increases oxygen supply to body cells, boosting metabolism and reducing BMI. Pranayama exercises like Kapalbhati and Bhastrika expel CO2 and draw in oxygen, aiding in weight reduction.
4. Better Digestion
Pranayama increases oxygen supply to the gut, enhancing blood flow and intestinal strength for better food absorption and digestion. Combined with yoga asanas, pranayama reduces stress and removes metabolic wastes.
5. Lowers Hypertension/High Blood Pressure - Pranayama practices like Bhramari, Anulom Vilom , and Sitali have a calming effect, reducing stress and high blood pressure. They relax stressed nerves, slow the heart rate, expand blood vessels, and lower blood pressure.
Emotional Benefits of Pranayama
1. Develops Concentration & Mindfulness
Pranayama trains you to focus on the breath, increasing mindfulness and concentration. It boosts brain areas related to awareness, thought, and attention, improving mental clarity.
2. Relieves Stress
 Pranayama calms nerves and vital organs by increasing oxygen supply to the body and brain, reducing stress and anxiety, and improving focus.
3. Promotes Sleep
Slow breathing pranayamas before bed relax the mind and body, creating a peaceful environment for sleep. Pranayama reduces blood pressure, heart rate, emotional blockages, and negativity.
4. Helps in Practicing Positive Thinking
Pranayama fosters a positive outlook by training you to focus on the present moment and create harmony between breath, mind, and body. It equips you to handle stressors with a positive approach.
5. Brings in More Balance
Pranayama helps balance emotions, reducing anger and restlessness. It creates awareness, heals emotional wounds, and achieves physical, mental, and emotional equilibrium.
Conclusion
Pranayama is a powerful practice that regulates prana or life force. The pranayama breathing techniques aim to achieve a balanced state of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. Regular practice of pranayama significantly improves the quality and span of life, highlighting the advantages of pranayama, benefits of pranayama, and the overall importance of pranayama.

Anulom Vilom, also known as Alternate Nostril Breathing, is more than just a relaxation technique; it is a scientifically supported practice for systemic health. As of 2026, clinical trials have expanded its use into specialized fields like neurology and chronic respiratory management. 
1. Advanced Physiological Impact
Neurological Function: Recent 2025 research indicates that the practice significantly reduces both auditory and visual reaction times. This suggests improved sensory-motor performance and faster central nervous system processing, which is beneficial for high-focus tasks like sports or specialized surgery.
Lung Micro-Health: It enhances the functionality of alveoli (lung air sacs) by promoting the release of surfactants. This lowers surface tension, allowing the lungs to expand more fully and increasing overall vital capacity.
Myocardial Efficiency: Studies from 2024-2025 show a significant decrease in the Rate Pressure Product (RPP), which indicates reduced myocardial oxygen demand. This means the heart works more efficiently with less strain. 
2. Specialized Clinical Benefits
Parkinson's Disease (PD): A 12-week randomized controlled trial completed in 2025 found that Anulom Vilom, as an adjunctive therapy, improves cardiac autonomic balance and overall quality of life for individuals with mild-to-moderate PD.
Asthma Management: Research published in late 2025 confirmed that practicing for just 10 minutes daily can significantly improve FEV1 scores (a measure of lung function) and reduce dyspnea in chronic bronchial asthma patients.
Hormonal & Women's Health: Recent 2025 studies have demonstrated that even a single session can be beneficial in reducing symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) by balancing the autonomic nervous system. 
3. Safety & Strict Contraindications (2026 Update)
While generally safe, updated medical guidelines specify that certain groups should avoid or strictly modify the practice:
Avoid Breath Retention (Kumbhaka): Essential for those with high blood pressure, heart disease, or during the late stages of pregnancy.
Active Infections: Do not practice if you have active tuberculosis, COVID-19, or severe respiratory infections.
Vertigo and Low BP: Those with severe vertigo or chronic hypotension (low blood pressure) should be cautious, as the practice further lowers blood pressure and may cause lightheadedness.
Post-Surgery: Always allow full healing after nasal or abdominal surgery before beginning. 
4. Optimal Practice Duration
For therapeutic results, contemporary research suggests:
Beginners: 3-5 minutes daily.
Advanced Goal: Gradually increase toward a goal of 10-15 minutes (or approximately 60 full cycles) spaced throughout the day for maximum autonomic stabilization. 

Kapalabhati Pranayama is a very powerful breathing exercise well known to yoga practitioners. Kapalabhati means shining intellect, and that's exactly what the regular and correct practice of this pranayama can achieve. It refines your intellect giving you the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, true and false, real and unreal.  For this reason alone, I consider Kapalabhati pranayama to be an essential yoga practice.
The other benefits of Kapalabhati Pranayama are:
- tones abdominal muscles
- improves digestion
- clears the nadis
- increases the quantity of prana
- stimulates all energy centres, in particular, the energy centres in the areas of naval, genitals, and in between eyebrows.
Learning the Kapalabhati pranayama technique:
Sit comfortably in any position, preferably cross-legged. Keep your spine erect.
Let's first focus on the breath alone.  Exhale through the nostrils with some force and sound, as though you are trying to clear your nostrils but don't tense your face much. And then inhale but without too much effort or force.
Take a few more such breaths in a rhythmical fashion at a medium pace, approximately 20 breaths in 15 seconds. Relax. Do this again 2-3 times.
Now let's co-ordinate the breath with moving of the belly in and out. As you exhale, contract your belly muscles and pull your naval inward toward the spine. Put some effort into contracting and pulling the belly in. Hold for about 1/2 a second. Then release the contraction as you inhale. Inhalation doesn't require much effort. Do this 20 times. It would take about 30 seconds to do it at medium pace. If you are having difficulty holding the belly contraction, practice at a slow speed. Effective contraction while pulling the belly in is a very important part of the practice. It gets easier and better with practice.
Practicing Kapalabhati Pranayama:
It is important to practice Kapalabhati in a spiritual manner.
1. Become aware that you are not just the body. Take your attention to your inner being. Go beyond your thoughts, questions and judgments.  Think of your inner-being as something very sacred, and honor it as you would honor a deity in a temple, with respect and gratefulness. This attitude is very necessary for awakening Kundilini and your energy centres. Without this attitude of honoring, the practice would provide benefit only at the physical level.
2. Sit erect with hands on thighs, palms facing up, eyes closed. Chant OM three times.
3. Take 20 Kapalabhati breaths as learnt above at a medium pace.  Relax your breath and be still for about 5-10 seconds. Feel the effect of pranayama without any judgments. This will connect you more to your inner being.
4. Take couple of deep and long breaths. Then do another round of 20 kapalabhati breaths as above, and again be still for 5-10 seconds.
5. Complete one more round same as step 4.
After three rounds of Kapalabhati remain still for few seconds and then continue with other practices. If you are not going to be doing other practices, then just be there quietly for a little longer period, 3-5 minutes.
After a few weeks of practice you can increase the pace of breathing without compromising the effective contraction and pulling-in of the belly. Also don't increase the pace so fast that you start to hyperventilate.
You can also increase the number of breaths in each round to up to 50 times.
But be very careful not to make this practice just a physical practice.
There is also an advanced Kapalabhati pranayama, which should be learnt only in person from an experienced yoga teacher. However, I personally prefer the basic practice as given above over the advanced one.
When to practice
Kapalabhati can be practiced any time of the day except late in the evening, no later than three hours before you go to sleep.  It must be practiced on an empty stomach. It can be practiced as a stand-alone practice or combined with other practices, such as before asanas or meditation.
Contraindications:
Kapalabhati should not be practiced during pregnancy or during first 2-3 days of the menstrual cycle. People with hernia and any other medical conditions should consult their physicians before starting the practice. I don't recommend Kapalabhati for children under 12.  There is no upper age limit.
Don't look for benefits: Though Kapalabhati pranayama and other practices provide many benefits; do your practices without expecting any benefits.
Practice with joy without expecting joy from practices.
Keep doing your practicing regularly. Don't give up. Do even more when you feel like giving up.  An accomplished athlete knows the value of practice. Many times he might have felt like giving up but he didn't. The essence of Yoga Vashishtha is continued self-effort.
Practice is not just doing postures and pranayamas. Applying the wisdom of yoga in daily life is also a practice. Following the yamas and niyamas (social and personal ethics) of Patanjali, and serving others are also essential yoga practices.

The Bhramari pranayama breathing technique derives its name from the black Indian bee called Bhramari. Bhramari pranayama is effective in instantly calming down the mind. It is one of the best breathing exercises to free the mind of agitation, frustration or anxiety and get rid of anger to a great extent. A simple technique, it can be practiced anywhere - at work or home and is an instant option to de-stress yourself.
The exhalation in this pranayama resembles the typical humming sound of a bee, which explains why it is named so.
The science behind Bhramari pranayama
It works on calming the nerves and soothes them especially around the brain and forehead. The humming sound vibrations have a natural calming effect.
How to do Bhramari pranayama
Sit up straight in a quiet, well-ventilated corner with your eyes closed. Keep a gentle smile on your face.
Keep your eyes closed for some time. Observe the sensations in the body and the quietness within.
Place your index fingers on your ears. There is a cartilage between your cheek and ear. Place your index fingers on the cartilage.
Take a deep breath in and as you breathe out, gently press the cartilage. You can keep the cartilage pressed or press it in and out with your fingers while making a loud humming sound like a bee.
You can also make a low-pitched sound but it is a good idea to make a high-pitched one for better results.
Breathe in again and continue the same pattern 3-4 times.
Preparatory poses and follow up poses
This is usually done after the warm-up at the start of the yoga practice. However, you can practice this later too.
Variations in Bhramari pranayama
You can also practice Bhramari pranayama lying on your back or lying on your right. While practicing the pranayama while lying down, just make the humming sound and do not worry about keeping your index finger on the ear. You can practice the Bhramari pranayama 3-4 times every day.

Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, or "alternate nostril breathing," is a simple yet powerful technique that calms your mind, relaxes your body, and balances your emotions. It is a great technique to practice to conclude your yoga (poses) routine or just before your daily meditation. It also helps ease racing thoughts if you are experiencing anxiety, stress right before a business meeting or having trouble falling asleep.
If you want to feel more balanced and calmer, this is the breathing technique you've been looking for! Let's inhale and dive in!
 
Alternate nostril breathing: two common variations
Alternate nostril breathing in Sanskrit is called Nadi Shodhan Pranayama, which translates to "subtle energy clearing breathing technique". The name is often synonymously used for Anulom Vilom Pranayama. In Nadi Shodhana, you may optionally hold the breath briefly (for a couple of seconds) after each inhalation and exhalation. 
 
10 Benefits of alternate nostril breathing
There are many more pranayama techniques you can learn. But this soothing alternate nostril breathing is on the top of the list for the positive effect that it offers, especially for its psychological benefits.
According to Business Insider, Hillary Clinton attested to using the alternate nostril breathing technique as a saving grace during the stressful 2016 presidential election.
Yes, the world is now catching onto the benefits of yogic breathing exercises! Whether running for president or running late for work, alternate nostril breathing is an excellent way to tap into the body's natural stress-reduction mechanisms.
This slow yogic breathing technique is a great way to end your yoga asana practices. After yoga, do nine rounds of alternate nostril breathing followed by a soothing meditation. 
Alternate nostril breathing helps calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and brings a feeling of relaxation to the entire body. It also relaxes the mind in preparation for meditation, which can be helpful for those struggling to settle down before meditating. 
When performed for just a few minutes, alternate nostril breathing can instantly reduce stress and fatigue. It is also a quick and efficient practice to do before high-stress situations such as job interviews and public speaking engagements.
 
Alternate nostril breathing:
1. Calms and centers the mind. Activates the 'rest and restore' functions of the parasympathetic nervous system.
2. Brings the mind to the present moment and out of the past (releasing old fears, regrets, and worries)
3. Helps improve function of the circulatory and respiratory systems
4. It improves breathing and can help you breathe better. Research found that over one month of practice, people had better oxygen flow and could exhale more oxygen. People who can exhale high amounts have healthier lungs.
5. Relieves stress and relaxes the body and mind. One study found that after practicing alternate nostril breathing for 12 weeks, male participants reported lower levels of stress. Another study found that this technique helped lower stress in pregnant survivors of intimate partner violence.
6. Harmonizes the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which correlate to the logical and emotional sides of our personality 
7. Purifies and balances the nadis (subtle energy channels) ensuring a smooth flow of prana (life force) through the body
8. Soothes the nervous system
9. Helps to maintain body temperature
10. Helps to lower blood pressure (though not a substitute for medication). One study found that alternate nostril breathing decreases blood pressure while increasing alertness. (For that reason, this breathing technique isn't your best choice before bed. To lull yourself to sleep, try Ujjayi or Victory breathing instead.)
 
How to practice the alternate nostril breathing
It's an easy technique to hit the reset button and calm the mind. Next time you find yourself doing too many things at once, or you sense panic or anxiety begin to rise, just practice a few rounds of alternate nostril breathing as per following steps:
1. Sit in a comfortable position with your spine long and your hips relaxed. Relax your face. Close your eyes.
2. Left hand in chin mudra: Place your left hand on your left knee with the palm facing upward in a hand position called Chin Mudra, by gently touching the tips of your index finger and thumb together, with the remaining fingers gently outstretched.
3. Right hand in nasagra mudra: Rest the tip of the index finger and middle finger of the right hand lightly on your forehead in between the eyebrows. Your ring finger and little finger will close the left nostril, and alternately the thumb will close the right nostril. 
4. Take a deep breath in, as you exhale, close the right nostril with your thumb and breathe out through your left nostril and get ready for the first round of this breathing exercise.
5. Inhale slowly through the left nostril, then close the left nostril with your ring finger.
6. Open the right nostril and gradually and evenly breathe out completely.
7. Breathe in smoothly through the right nostril.
8. Now close the night nostril with the thumb, breathe out through the left nostril.
9. The steps 5 and 8 constitute one round of alternate nostril breathing once you prepare for the practice with steps (1 to 4). Continue similarly to perform nine rounds over a period of 5 minutes. Or practice for 5 minutes. 
* Remember to always inhale through the same nostril you just exhaled through
* Keep your breath even, slow, and gentle all throughout
* Finish your final round with an exhalation on the left side
 
Beginner tip: 
If you are a beginner, breathe in for four counts and exhale for four counts. As you improve in your practice, your exhalation could be a little longer (six to eight counts) than your inhalation (four counts). 
 
Tip for experienced practitioners:
As you advance in your practice, you can gradually increase the length of your breaths. You can also add breath retention after each inhalation and exhalation.  
For even more clarity, you can follow this easy video so that you are confident in practicing alternate nostril breathing on your own. For further support, you can seek guidance from a yoga or meditation instructor familiar with how to practice alternate nostril breathing.
6 things to remember when you practice alternate nostril breathing
1. The breathing pattern is: breathe in, breathe out, switch sides, and repeat. 
2. End each round with an exhalation on the left side.
3. Do not force the breath, keep it gentle and natural. Allow the breath to be smooth and even without creating force or pressure. 
4. Do not breathe through the mouth or make any sound when practicing.
5. Place the fingers very lightly on the forehead and nose. There is no need to apply much pressure.
6. Regular practice will give you the most benefits.

What is the diaphragm?
The diaphragm is the most efficient muscle for breathing. It's a large, dome-shaped muscle located at the base of your lungs. Your abdominal muscles help move the diaphragm and give you more power to empty your lungs.
What is diaphragmatic breathing?
Diaphragmatic breathing helps you use your diaphragm correctly while breathing to:
Strengthen the diaphragm.
Decrease the work of breathing by slowing your breathing rate.
Decrease oxygen demand.
Use less effort and energy to breathe.
During diaphragmatic breathing, you consciously use your diaphragm to take deep breaths. When you breathe normally, you don't use your lungs to their full capacity. Diaphragmatic breathing allows you to use your lungs at 100% capacity to increase lung efficiency.
What are other names for diaphragmatic breathing?
Diaphragmatic breathing is also known as:
Abdominal breathing.
Belly breathing.
Do certain conditions make it harder for me to use my diaphragm?
Conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may prevent the diaphragm from working effectively.
Your lungs rise and fall naturally, but when you have COPD, air often becomes trapped in your lungs. This pushes down on your diaphragm. Your neck and chest muscles must then assume an increased share of the work of breathing. Conditions like COPD can leave your diaphragm weakened and flattened, causing it to work less efficiently.
What are the benefits of diaphragmatic breathing?
Diaphragmatic breathing offers several benefits to your body including:
Helping you relax.
Improving muscle function during exercises and preventing strain.
Increasing how much oxygen is in your blood.
Making it easier for your body to release gas waste from your lungs.
Reducing blood pressure.
Reducing heart rate.
What conditions does diaphragmatic breathing help improve?
Diaphragmatic breathing can help several conditions that cause symptoms that affect how you breathe including:
Anxiety.
Asthma.
COPD.
Stress.
Diaphragmatic breathing can help treat certain conditions, but it shouldn't be the only treatment. You can use this technique along with other treatments recommended by your healthcare provider.
How do I do diaphragmatic breathing exercises?
When you first learn the diaphragmatic breathing technique, it may be easier for you to follow the instructions lying down.
Lie on your back on a flat surface or in bed, with your knees bent and your head supported. You can use a pillow under your knees to support your legs.
Place one hand on your upper chest and the other just below your rib cage. This will allow you to feel your diaphragm move as you breathe.
Breathe in slowly through your nose so that your stomach moves out, causing your hand to rise. The hand on your chest should remain as still as possible.
Tighten your stomach muscles, so that your stomach moves in, causing your hand to lower as you exhale through pursed lips (see "Pursed Lip Breathing Technique"). The hand on your upper chest should remain as still as possible.
Diaphragmatic breathing technique (sitting)
As you gain more practice, you can try the diaphragmatic breathing technique while sitting in a chair.
To perform this exercise while sitting in a chair:
Sit comfortably, with your knees bent and your shoulders, head and neck relaxed.
Place one hand on your upper chest and the other just below your rib cage. This will allow you to feel your diaphragm move as you breathe.
Breathe in slowly through your nose so that your stomach moves out against your hand. The hand on your chest should remain as still as possible.
Tighten your stomach muscles, so that your stomach moves back in, as you exhale through pursed lips. The hand on your upper chest must remain as still as possible.
Do I need to practice diaphragmatic breathing?
Yes, practicing diaphragmatic breathing makes it easier. You may notice it takes an increased effort to use your diaphragm correctly. At first, you'll probably get tired while doing this exercise. But keep at it, because with continued practice diaphragmatic breathing will become automatic.
How often should I practice diaphragmatic breathing exercises?
At first, practice this exercise for five to 10 minutes about three to four times per day. Gradually increase the amount of time you spend doing this exercise, and perhaps even increase the effort of the exercise by placing a book on your abdomen.
